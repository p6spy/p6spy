p6spy
=====

p6spy from the original sourceforge project. The build is currently unstable.

P6Spy is a framework that enables database data to be seamlessly intercepted and manipulated with no code changes to existing application. The P6Spy distribution includes P6Log, an application which logs all JDBC transactions for any Java application.

**Note: This is NOT a fork of the original project.  This is the new home of this project.**
