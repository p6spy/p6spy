/**
 * This class is a singleton. Since P6Spy is normally loaded by the system
 * classpath, it is a normally a singleton across the JVM.
 * The instance will determine if a statement has been long running and log
 * the statement when such a statment is found. It accomplishes this by
 * spawning a daemon thread which will wake up at configurable intervals of
 * time (defined in seconds) and check if a statement is still executing since
 * the last time the thread was awake. This is accomplished by this instance
 * maintaining a list of active statements. The P6Statement and P6PreparedStatement
 * objects will reqister their call with the instance just before the SQL call
 * is delegated to the real driver. Once that statement finishes executing, the
 * statement object will unregister that call from list. If during that time
 * the thread in this instance sees the execute time exceed the threshold, it is
 * flagged as a long-running statement and logged. The statement will continue
 * to be logged if it appears in future iterations of the sleep/wake cycle.
 * This class is implemented with lazy thread sychronization. The list of
 * pending statements is a synchronized container, the rest is left open to
 * thread hazards to reduce the performance impact. So the logging results might be
 * slightly unreliable, but we aren't dealing with bank accounts here so thats
 * okay.
