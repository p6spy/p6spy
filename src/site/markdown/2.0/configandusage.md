# <a name="confusage">Configuration and Usage</a>

Configuration follows **layered approach**, where **each layer overrides the values set by the lower ones** 
(leaving those not provided unchanged):

* Connection specific properties (see: [Connection specific properties](#connectionproperties))
* JMX set properties (please note, that these are reset on next reload)
* System properties
* Environment variables
* spy.properties
* defaults

For the full list of available options, see the section [Common Property File Settings](#settings). 
Please note that providing any of these via System properties/Environment variables/[Connection specific properties](#connectionproperties) is possible, using the particular 
property name following naming rule: `p6spy.config.<property name>=<property value>`

Please be aware of the restriction. In fact this also means you need to be aware of values set by the lower 
configuration layers (including defaults) to properly override/modify those.

There are **two cases one needs to distinguish when overriding**:

* don't override the property on the current level (can be achieved by specifying neither key nor value) and 
* clear the property value (can be achieved by specifying the key empty string value, could be for specified in `spy.properties` like this: `excludecategories=`)

The `spy.properties` configuration file can be located in various places.  The following locations are searched
to locate the file.  

1. The file name configured in the system property "spy.properties" (can include path)
1. The current working directory (for relative path) or any directory (for absolute path)
1. The classpath

## <a name="connectionproperties">Connection specific properties</a>

Properties can be specific for particular connection. To provide multiple via JDBC URL, use ';' as a separator.

So following would be valid JDBC URLs: 

* `jdbc:p6spy:mysql://<hostname>:<port>/<database>`
* `jdbc:p6spy:p6spy.config.<property name>=<property value>:mysql://<hostname>:<port>/<database>`
* `jdbc:p6spy:p6spy.config.<property name>=<property value>;p6spy.config.<property name2>=<property value2>:mysql://<hostname>:<port>/<database>`

Please note, that all the properties that support connection specific overriding have it explicitly mentioned in the config file (as well as in the [Common Property File Settings](#settings) section), stating: `(available as a connection specific property)`.

If you need yet unsupported properties to be set on this level, feel free to [raise a bug](https://github.com/p6spy/p6spy/issues/new) indicating that.

## Properties exposal via JMX

Please note that all the properties are exposed via JMX (With one exception, namely: [Connection specific properties](#connectionproperties)). So you can use your tool of choice (e.g.,JConsole) to view/change them. 
Moreover reload operation is exposed as well. To provide on-demand reload option.

In the JConsole p6spy related JMX attributes might look like this:

![JConsole](../images/jconsole.png)

## Command Line Options

Every parameter specified in the property file can be set and overriden at the command line using the Java -D flag (system property), adding the the prefix: 

    p6spy.config.

An example follows:

    java -Dp6spy.config.logfile=my.log -Dp6spy.config.append=true

Moreover to set different file to be used as the properties file (as an example: another_spy.properties), it should be specified using system property "spy.properties" as:

    java -Dspy.properties=c:\jboss\lib\another_spy.properties

## <a name="settings">Common Property File Settings</a>

An example `spy.properties` file follows (please note default values mentioned as these refer to defaults mentioned 
in section: [Configuration and Usage](#confusage)):

    # When this feature is enabled, no other statements are logged except the long

    # For example, if this is set to 2, then any statement requiring at least 2
    # seconds will be logged. Note that the same statement will continue to be logged
    # for as long as it executes. So if the interval is set to 2, and the query takes

### modulelist

modulelist holds the list of p6spy modules activated. A module contains a group of functionality. If none are specified only core
p6spy framework will be activated (no logging,...). Still once reload of the properties happen, or these are set by JMX, modules would be
dynamically loaded/unloaded.

The following modules come with the p6spy by default:


    modulelist=com.p6spy.engine.logging.P6LogFactory,com.p6spy.engine.outage.P6OutageFactory


Where these are required:

* com.p6spy.engine.logging.P6LogFactory - for the logging functionality, see [P6Log](#p6log).
* com.p6spy.engine.outage.P6OutageFactory - for outage functionality, see [P6Outage](#p6outage).
 
Please note to implement custom module have a look at the implementation of the any of the existing ones.

### driverlist

This is a comma separated list of JDBC driver classes to load and register with DriverManager. You should list
the classname(s) of the JDBC driver(s) that you want to proxy with P6Spy if any of the following conditions are met.

1. The JDBC driver does not implement the JDBC 4.0 API 
1. You are using a JNDI Data Source - Some application servers will prevent the automatic registration feature from working.  

### autoflush

For standard development, set the autoflush value to true. When set to true, every time a statement is intercepted, it
is immediately written to the log file. In some cases, however, instant feedback on every statement is not a
requirement. In those cases, the system performs slightly faster with autoflush set to false.

An example follows:

    autoflush = true

### dateformat

Setting a value for dateformat changes the date format value printed in the log file. No value prints the current time
in milliseconds (unix time), a useful feature for parsing the log. The date format engine is Java's SimpleDateFormat class.
Refer to the SimpleDateFormat class in the JavaDocs for information on setting this value. An example follows:

    dateformat=MM-dd-yy HH:mm:ss:SS

### stacktrace

If stacktrace is set, the log prints out the stack trace for each SQL statement logged.

### stacktraceclass

Limits the stack traces printed to those that contain the value set in stacktraceclass. For example, specifying stacktraceclass=com.mycompany.myclass limits the printing of stack traces to the specified class value. The stack trace is converted to a String and string.indexOf(stacktraceclass) is performed.

### reloadproperties and reloadpropertiesinterval

If reloadproperties is set to true, the property file is reloaded every n seconds, where n is defined by the value set by reloadpropertiesinterval. For example, if reloadproperties=true and reloadpropertiesinterval=10, the system checks the File.lastModified() property of the property file every 10 seconds, and if the file has been modified, it will be reloaded.

If you set append=true, the log will be suddenly truncated when you change your properties. This is because using reloadproperties is intended to be the equivalent of restarting your application server. Restarting your application server truncates your log file.

reloadproperties will not reload any driver information (such as realdriver, realdriver2, and realdriver3) and will not change the modules that are in memory.

### appender

Appenders allow you to specify where and how log information is output. Appenders are a flexible architecture
allowing anyone to write their own output class for P6Spy. To use an appender, specify the classname of the
appender to use. The current release comes with three options which are slf4j, stdout,
and logging to a file (default). Please note, that all of these output in the CSV format (where separator is: "|").

* **Using the File output**: Uncomment the `FileLogger` appender and specify a `logfile` and
  whether or not to `append` to the file or to clear the file each time:

        #appender=com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.Slf4JLogger
        #appender=com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.StdoutLogger
        appender=com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.FileLogger

        # name of logfile to use, note Windows users should make sure to use forward slashes in their pathname (e:/test/spy.log) 
	    # (used for com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.FileLogger only)
	    # (default is spy.log)
	    #logfile = spy.log

        # append to the p6spy log file. if this is set to false the
        # log file is truncated every time. (file logger only)
        append=true

* **Using StdOut**: Uncomment the `StdoutLogger` as follows:

        #appender=com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.Slf4JLogger
        appender=com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.StdoutLogger
        #appender=com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.FileLogger

* **Using SLF4J**: Uncomment the `Slf4JLogger` as follows:

        appender=com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.Slf4JLogger
        #appender=com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.StdoutLogger
        #appender=com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.FileLogger

	In general you need to slf4j-api and the appropriate bridge to the actual logging
implementation as well as the logging implementation itself on your classpath. To simplify setup for those not having any of the additional dependencies already
on classpath following `*-nodep.jar` bundles are provided as part of p6spy distribution:

    * `p6spy-<version>-log4j-nodep.jar` - having [log4j](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/) included,
    * `p6spy-<version>-log4j2-nodep.jar` - having [log4j2](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) included and
    * `p6spy-<version>-logback-nodep.jar` - having [logback](http://logback.qos.ch/) included.

    Mapping to SLF4J levels is provided in the following way:
    
	<table>
	<tr><th>P6Spy category</th><th>SLF4J level</th></tr>
	<tr><td>error</td><td>error</td></tr>
	<tr><td>warn</td><td>warn</td></tr>
	<tr><td>debug</td><td>debug</td></tr>
	<tr><td>info/any other category</td><td>info</td></tr>
	</table>
	
	Internally is Slf4j Logger is retrieved for the: `p6spy`, keep this in mind when configuring your logging implementation. So for example for the `log4j` following could be used to restrict the p6spy logging (if using xml-based configuration) to `INFO` level only:
	
          <category name="p6spy">
            <priority value="INFO" />
          </category>
	
	For further instructions on configuring SLF4J, see the [SLF4J documentation](http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html).

### logMessageFormat

The log message format is selected by specifying the class to use to format the log messages.  The following
classes are available with P6Spy.

* `com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.SingleLineFormat` which results in log messages in format:

		current time|execution time|category|instance id|connection id|statement SQL String|effective SQL string
		
* `com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.MultiLineFormat`, which results in log messages in format: 
		
		current time|execution time|category|instance id|connection id|statement SQL String
		effective SQL string

Where:

* `current time` - the current time is obtained through System.getCurrentTimeMillis() and represents
  the number of milliseconds that have passed since January 1, 1970 00:00:00.000 GMT.
  (Refer to the J2SE documentation for further details on System.getCurrentTimeMillis().)
  To change the format, use the dateformat property described in
  [Common Property File Settings](#settings).
* `execution time` - the time it takes in milliseconds for a particular method to execute. (This is
  not the total cost for the SQL statement.) For example, a statement
  `SELECT * FROM MYTABLE WHERE THISCOL = ?` might be executed as a prepared
  statement, in which the .execute() function will be measured. This is recorded as
  the statement category. Further, as you call .next() on the ResultSet, each .next()
  call is recorded in the result category.
* `category` - You can manage your log by including and excluding categories,
  which is described in [Common Property File Settings](#settings).
* `instance id` - Value of `instanceId` property. It makes sence for the case that more connections are proxied via p6spy and 
	user tries to group log messages by connection. (If `instanceId` property value is not provided => empty string is logged in the position.)
* `connection id` - Indicates the connection on which the activity was logged.  The connection id is a sequentially
  generated identifier.  
* `statement SQL string` - This is the SQL string passed to the statement object.
  If it is a prepared statement, it is the prepared statement that existed prior to
  the parameters being set. To see the complete statement, refer to effective SQL string.
* `effective SQL string` - If you are not using a prepared statement, this contains no
  value. Otherwise, it fills in the values of the Prepared Statement so you can see
  the effective SQL statement that is passed to the database. Of course, the database
  still sees the prepared statement, but this string is a convenient way to see the
  actual values being sent to the database.

The `com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.MultiLineFormat` might be better from a readability perspective.  Because it will place the effective SQL statement
on a separate line.  However, the SingleLineFormat might be better if you have a need to parse the log messages.
The default is `com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.SingleLineFormat` for backward compatibility.

You can also supply your own log message formatter to customize the format.  Simply create a class which implements
the `com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.MessageFormattingStrategy` interface and place it on the classpath.

### filter, include, exclude

P6Spy allows you to filter SQL queries by specific strings to be present (`includes` property value) or not present (`excludes` property value). 
As a precondition, setting `filter=true` has to be provided. 
P6Spy will perform string matching on each statement to determine if it should be written to the log file. 
`include` accepts a comma-delimited list of expressions which is required to appear in a statement before it can appear in the log. `exclude` accepts a comma-delimited list to exclude. 
Exclusion overrides inclusion, so that a statement matching both an include string and an exclude string is excluded.

Please note that matching mode used in the underlying regex is (achieved via prefix `(?mis)`):

* [multiline](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#MULTILINE),
* [dotall](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#DOTALL) and
* [case insensitive](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#CASE_INSENSITIVE).

An example showing capture of all statements having select, except those having order follow:

    filter = true
    # comma separated list of strings to include
    include = select
    # comma separated list of strings to exclude
    exclude = order

Please note, that internally following regex would be used for particular expression matching: `(?mis)^(?!.*(order).*)(.*(select).*)$`

An example showing only capture statements having any of: order_details, price, and price_history follows:

    filter = true
    # comma separated list of strings to include
    include = order,order_details,price,price_history
    # comma separated list of strings to exclude
    exclude =
    
Please note, that internally following regex would be used for particular expression matching: `(?mis)^(.*(order|order_details|price|price_history).*)$`

An example showing the capture of all statements, except statements order string in them follows:

    filter = false
    # comma separated list of strings to include
    include =
    # comma separated list of strings to exclude
    exclude = order

Please note, that internally following regex would be used for particular expression matching: `(?mis)^(?!.*(order).*)(.*)$`

As you can use full regex syntax, capture of statements having: pri[cz]e follows:

    filter = true
    # comma separated list of strings to include
    include = pri[cz]e
    # comma separated list of strings to exclude
    exclude =
    
Please note, that internally following regex would be used for particular expression matching: `(?mis)^(.*(pri[cz]e).*)$`

Moreover, please note, that special characters escaping (used in java) has to be done for the provided regular expression.
As an example, matching for:

	from\scustomers
	
would mean, that following should be specified (please note doubled backslash):
	
	filter=true
    include=from\\scustomers

### filter, sqlexpression

If you need more control over regular expression for matching, SQL string property `sqlexpression` is to be used as an alternative to `exclude` and `include`. 
An example follows:

    filter = true
    sqlexpression = your expression

If your expression matches the SQL string, it is logged. If the expression does not match, it is not logged. 
Please note you can use `sqlexpression` together with `include`/`exclude`, where both would be evaluated.

Moreover, please note, that special characters escaping (used in java) has to be done for the provided regular expression.
As an example, matching for:

	^(.*(from\scustomers).*)$
	
would mean, that following should be specified (please note doubled backslash)::
	
	filter=true
    sqlexpression=^(.*(from\\scustomers).*)$

### excludecategories

The log includes category information that describes the type of statement. This property excludes the listed categories. Valid options include the following:

* `error` includes P6Spy errors. (It is recommended that you include this category.)
* `info` includes driver startup information and property file information.
* `debug` is only intended for use when you cannot get your driver to work properly, because it writes everything.
* `statement` includes Statements, PreparedStatements, and CallableStatements.
* `batch` includes calls made to the addBatch() JDBC API.
* `commit` includes calls made to the commit() JDBC API.
* `rollback` includes calls made to the rollback() JDBC API.
* `result` includes statements generated by ResultSet.

Enter a comma-delimited list of categories to exclude from your log file. See filter, include, exclude for more details on how this process works.

### outagedetection

This feature detects long-running statements that may be indicative of a database outage
problem. When enabled, it logs any statement that surpasses the configurable time boundary during its execution.
No other statements are logged except the long-running statements.

### outagedetectioninterval 

The interval property is the boundary time set in seconds. For example, if set to
2, any statement requiring at least 2 seconds is logged. The same statement will continue to be logged for as
long as it executes. So, if the interval is set to 2 and a query takes 11 seconds, it is logged 5 times (at
the 2, 4, 6, 8, 10-second intervals).
