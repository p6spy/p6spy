/**
 * SQL batch file logger Private: (?) No Appender that writes a trace of JDBC activity into an SQL
 * batch file that can be later "replayed" using a generic SQL client.
 * <p>
 * modify the spy.properties file to make p6spy use this appender by setting
 * appender=com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.BatchFileLogger.
 * </p>
 * <p>Here's how it works for me: logfile = spy.sql The appender writes the text of SQL
 * statements as well as commit and rollback commands to the specified file, each on a new line. For
 * prepared statements the effective text resulting from substitution of parameter signs with their
 * values is written. Other event categories are logged as SQL comments ("-- " followed by the
 * category name). Exceptions and text are silently discarded. All SQL statements except the last
 * one will have a delimiter character ';' appended to them. This batch format works well with
 * WinSQL. The format is hardcoded, so if you want to make it configurable you'll have to patch my
 * patch or write your own :)
